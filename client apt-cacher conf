 Use as a proxy to APT




1:  In a terminal, type:


sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy



Inside your new file, add a line that says:


Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<IP address or hostname of the apt-cacher server>:3142";


Alternatively, edit /etc/apt/sources.list so all your HTTP sources are prepended with the address of your apt-cacher machine and the port, like this:
deb http://example.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free
becomes
deb http://sys11:3142/example.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib non-free
