SERVER CONFIGURATIONS :

GENERAL CONFIGURATION FOR SERVER 

1:  install apt-cacher and apache web server 

sudo apt-get install apt-cacher apache2

2: Enable apt-cacher

Edit /etc/default/apt-cacher and change autostart to 1

3:  Restart apache: 

   sudo service apache2 restart



#Test apt-cacher by pointing your web browser to http://localhost:3142/apt-cacher 

4:

Edit /etc/apt-cacher/apt-cacher.conf Uncomment the following line:

allowed_hosts = * 


5 :  Change the admin_email email address to something meaningful.



6:     If you want to cache multiple distributions, uncomment the line and set distinct_namespaces value to 1:

distinct_namespaces = 1


7:

 By default apt-cacher may have problems with upgrades of ubuntu from one version to another when running do-release-upgrade -d This can be fixed by uncommenting the line beginning with installer_files_regexp and modifying it from:

installer_files_regexp = ^(?:vmlinuz|linux|initrd\.gz|changelog|NEWS.Debian|UBUNTU_RELEASE_NAMES\.tar\.gz(?:\.gpg)?|(?:Devel|EOL)?ReleaseAnnouncement(?:\.html)?|meta-release(?:-lts)?(?:-(?:development|proposed))?)$

to:

installer_files_regexp = ^(?:vmlinuz|linux|initrd\.gz|changelog|NEWS.Debian|[a-z]+\.tar\.gz(?:\.gpg)?|UBUNTU_RELEASE_NAMES\.tar\.gz(?:\.gpg)?|(?:Devel|EOL)?ReleaseAnnouncement(?:\.html)?|meta-release(?:-lts)?(?:-(?:development|proposed))?)$





8:

Restart apt-cacher: 

   sudo service apt-cacher restart




Import any existing packages into the cache by creating symlinks:

   sudo /usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl -l /var/cache/apt/archives


Configure the server's Apt process to run through the cache


sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy
Inside your new file, add a line that says:


Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<IP address or hostname of the apt-cacher server>:3142";


Save the file and then on the server run  apt-get update  

If that succeeds without errors then update your server with  apt-get dist-upgrade
